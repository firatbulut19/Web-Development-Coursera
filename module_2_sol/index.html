        <p class="text">Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated. There are different studies that suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before our time. The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in the range where they occur (parts of Australia).</p>

        </div>
        <p class="text">Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous (meat-eating) mammals, of the family Felidae. Domestic cats are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets. Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years. There are also farm cats, which are kept on farms to keep rodents away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans. They are one of the most popular pets in the world. They are kept by humans for hunting rodents and companionship. There are about 60 breeds of cat.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="text">Frogs are amphibians and vertebrates of the order Anura. There is not much difference between frogs and toads, and they are not classified separately. This is because the toad lifestyle, with its dry, rough, skin, is an adaptation to living in drier habitats. The toad form has evolved a number of times independently, an example of convergent evolution.</p>
